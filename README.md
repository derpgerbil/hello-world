# hello-world
rep for random ideas and projects

Hello GitHub!

I'm derpgerbil, and I prefer working with Python and Java, though I'm open to branching out and learning more languages.
This repository is here as a placeholder for potential projects, as well as a place to dump random ideas and other mumblings.
